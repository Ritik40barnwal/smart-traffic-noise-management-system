# smart-traffic-noise-management-system
An Arduino-based noise monitoring system with Telegram Bot integration. Detects high noise levels via sound sensor, triggers LED alerts, and sends real-time notifications. Simulated on Tinkercad with Python bridge for Telegram API.

Noise Level Alert with Telegram Notifications

This project demonstrates a noise monitoring traffic light system using Arduino.
The system continuously monitors the ambient noise level through an analog input (sound sensor or potentiometer in simulation). If the noise exceeds a predefined threshold, the traffic light switches to Red and a Telegram notification is sent to the user. Once the noise level returns to normal, another notification is sent indicating recovery.

Features

Real-time noise detection using analog input.

Traffic light simulation (Red, Yellow, Green) with LEDs.

High noise alert sent to Telegram: "‚ö†Ô∏è Noise too high!".

Normal condition update sent to Telegram: "‚úÖ Level normal. Holding red for 2 sec...".

Works in:

Tinkercad with Arduino Uno + Python bridge script.

Wokwi with ESP32 (direct WiFi + Telegram API).

Technology Stack

Arduino Uno / ESP32 (hardware or simulation).

Tinkercad / Wokwi for virtual prototyping.

Python (pyserial + requests) for handling Serial input and Telegram API (Uno version).

Telegram Bot API for notifications.

Applications

Classroom / library noise monitoring.

Industrial noise level alerts.

Smart traffic control systems.

Do you want me to also add a Setup & Usage section (with steps to run in Tinkercad + Python and ESP32 + Wokwi) so it looks like a full GitHub-ready README?

Noise Level Alert with Telegram Notifications

This project implements a noise monitoring and alert system using Arduino, with optional integration to Telegram Bot API for real-time notifications. The system is designed to detect ambient noise levels and provide both a visual indication through LEDs (traffic light simulation) and a remote notification when the noise crosses a predefined threshold.

Overview

The Arduino reads input from a sound sensor (or potentiometer in simulation).

If noise exceeds the threshold, the Red LED activates and a Telegram alert is sent:

"‚ö†Ô∏è Noise too high!"

When noise returns to normal, the system holds Red for 2 seconds, then restores normal operation while sending:

"‚úÖ Level normal. Holding red for 2 sec...".

Key Features

Traffic Light Simulation: Green, Yellow, and Red LEDs represent noise states.

Noise Alerts: Instant notification to Telegram when noise is high.

Normal Condition Alerts: Recovery message when levels stabilize.

Cross-Platform Simulation:

Tinkercad + Python Bridge: Arduino Uno sends Serial data to a Python script, which communicates with Telegram.

Wokwi + ESP32: Direct WiFi integration with Telegram Bot API, no Python bridge required.

Technology Stack

Arduino Uno / ESP32

Tinkercad / Wokwi for simulation

Python (pyserial, requests) for Serial-to-Telegram bridge

Telegram Bot API for notifications

Applications

Monitoring classroom or library noise levels

Industrial noise compliance systems

Smart city traffic management (noise-sensitive zones)

This project provides a simple yet effective prototype for IoT-based noise monitoring, combining embedded hardware simulation with cloud messaging.
